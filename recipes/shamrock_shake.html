    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy Shamrock Shake is a blend of vanilla ice cream, milk, mint extract, and green food coloring for a fun St. Patrick's Day treat. This recipe has become a tradition in our house. The kids love it, and so do I!</p>
    <h2>What Is a Shamrock Shake?</h2>
    <p>The Shamrock Shake is a creamy seasonal milkshake that is famously sold at McDonald's during March to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Introduced in 1970, the shake originally had a lemon-lime flavor. It is still vibrant green, but it is mint-flavored these days.</p>
    <h2>Shamrock Shake Ingredients</h2>
