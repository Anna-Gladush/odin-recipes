    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cherry cake is a lovely white loaf cake packed with glacé cherries for an easy fruitcake that's perfect for gifting. Serve dusted with powdered sugar for a festive touch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (1x)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>12 ounces golden raisins</li>
        <li>8 ounces halved glace cherries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in orange juice until smooth.</li>
        <li>Sift flour and baking powder. Reserve 1/3 cup of the flour mixture and toss with raisins and cherries to help keep them suspended in the batter. Stir remaining flour mixture into batter until just combined. Fold in floured raisins and cherries.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 2 hours and 15 minutes. Cool completely before wrapping tightly in plastic wrap or foil. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for several days to allow flavor to develop.</li>
    </ol>
